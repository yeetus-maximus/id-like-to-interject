The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. <span class="editable">Linux</span> is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with <span class="editable">Linux</span> added, or GNU/<span class="editable">Linux</span>.
